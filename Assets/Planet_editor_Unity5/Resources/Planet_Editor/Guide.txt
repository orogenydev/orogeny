Thanks for purchasing this asset!

Let's see what we have in a demo scene:

1. Each planet consists of 4 elements:
 - Planet mesh with planet shader and 7 blended textures
 - Water sphere with water shader
 - Glow sphere(special glow shader)
 - Clouds sphere with clouds shader and script that makes clouds texture look dynamic.
2. Main camera has one child (creating colliders notification) and 2 scripts:
 - Sculpt - main sculpting script with 6 main vars:
	1) Brush transform - brush projector 
	2) Brush texture down
	3) Brush texture up
	4) Realistic shader(the one that works with lights)
	5) Cartoon shader
	6) Planet transform
 - Planet_control - script that defines planet size and is used to rotate camera around planet. Has 2 main vars:
	1) Planet transform
	2) Size - basically, planet scale how big you want your planet to be. Unity scale high poly objects very slow, 
	   so it's much better to do it only once. Basic planet radius is 25. Use this scale in order to make the planet bigger. 
	   You may need to increase light, projector and camera influence zones(range and clipping planes), and light position.
3. Brush - simple projector.
4. Light with lens flare as a child.
--------------------------------------------------
Shaders:
1. Planet shaders:
 - height_based - cartoon planet shader. Unlit shader type.
 - height_based_w_light - relistic planet shader, that works with point and directional lights.
2. Atmosphere - clouds shader. Works with point and directional lights.
3. Glow shader - shader based on Unity wiki glow shader.
4. Water shaders:
 - water_cartoon shader - water is visible from any angle
 - water_realistic shader - water is invisible on the unlit part of the planet

---------------------------------------------------

Prefab_saver script. It's located in Editor. 
This scripts create a "Create a prefab from selected" btn in gameobject menu.
So, you choose your planet  in editor hierarchy, then press this button and you get your planet prefab with mesh and all materials
and current settings save in savedMesh folder!
---------------------------------------------------

Planets resolution:
 - big: 25k vertices
 - medium: 6k vertices
 - big: 2.5k vertices
